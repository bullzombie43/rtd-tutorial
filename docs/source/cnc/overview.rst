Overview
--------

A CNC router is a tool that uses a special cutter known as an endmill, sort of like a drill bit that specializes in cutting sideways, 
instead of vertically, that is programmed to travel along a specific path through Computer Numerated Control (CNC). 
Generally when we say CNC, we refer to the machine. This is a powerful machine that can make consistent and precise parts completely automatically. Being able to leverage this tool effectively 
is critical to the success of this team.
Compared to CNC mills, CNC routers have a very large cutting surface that make it ideal for cutting boards of wood and sheets of metal. However, due to their typically weaker and less 
rigid spindle assemblies are unable to cut harder metals and make precise 3 dimensional parts as seen on mills. Thankfully in FRC, most robots are assembled out of aluminum, a comparatively soft metal. Our parts are also designed with the limitations of our machines in mind.

This guide, as well as operating a CNC machine, is divided into two sections. The first section is about creating programs for the CNC through Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) 
as well as understanding the resulting G-Code which is what the machine interprets. The second section will be about operating the CNC and understanding Mach3Mill, 
which is the Controller Software that controls our CNCs. The second section will also cover the actual operation of the machine, safety, set ups, and maintenance.
