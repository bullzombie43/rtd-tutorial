What is Programming ?
=====================

Programming Languages
---------------------

Programming languages are the means by which we communicate with computers to give them instructions. 
Examples include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.
Each language is suited to different tasks, offering different syntax and paradigms.

Code Structure
--------------

- **Programs and Functions** 
A program is a collection of instructions executed by a computer. 
These instructions are often organized into functions, which are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

- **Variables and Data Types** 
Variables store data that can be manipulated within a program. 
Common data types include integers, strings, booleans, and arrays.

Development tools
-----------------

- **Text Editors and IDEs** 
Text editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are used to write code.
IDEs offer additional tools such as code completion, error checking, and debugging features that 
make programming easier. One popular lightweight IDE is called VSCode.

- **Version Control** 
Version control systems (like Git) track changes to code, allowing multiple developers 
to collaborate on the same project and revert to previous versions if needed.
We'll talk a lot about git later, but a here is a fantastic tutorial on it if you want to start early.
Its a bit long so you might want to watch 2x speed.

Software Development Practices
-----------------

- **Debugging and Testing** 
Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in the code. Testing involves running 
the code under various conditions to ensure it behaves as expected. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end 
tests are common types of tests used in software development.

- **Documentation** 
Documentation involves writing descriptions and instructions to help others understand and use the code. 
Good documentation includes comments within the code, as well as external documents like README files, 
user manuals, and API documentation.

Deploying and Maintaining Software
-----------------

- **Deployment** 
Deployment is the process of moving code from a development environment to a production environment. 
This may involve compiling code, configuring servers, and managing resources.

- **Maintenance** 
Once a program is live, regular maintenance is necessary to fix bugs, add features, and improve performance. 
Keeping code clean and modular is key to easier maintenance over time.

Conclusion
-----------------
Programming is a broad field with many specialized areas, but all developers need to understand 
these core concepts. Whether youâ€™re building a simple script or a complex application, 
mastering these fundamentals will help ensure success and scalability in your projects.
